# TASK1 : Fiber Switching in C++ with Context Library

This project demonstrates the implementation of fiber switching in C++ using a provided context library. Fibers are lightweight threads with their own stack, and this example shows how to switch between different fibers.

## Introduction

In this project, we implement a simple program that utilizes the provided context library to switch between different fibers. The context library consists of functions to save and restore the execution state, allowing for the creation of lightweight fibers.



## Building

1. Assemble Assembly Code:
This command assembles the context.s assembly file into machine code and saves the result in context.o.

2. Compile C++ Source Code to Object File:
This command compiles the fibers.cpp source file into machine code and saves the result in fibers.o.

3. Link Object Files to Create Executable:
This command links the previously compiled fibers.o and context.o object files into an executable named fibers.

```bash
as -o context.o context.s
g++ -c fibers.cpp -o fibers.o
g++ fibers.o context.o -o fibers

```
## Running
Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./fibers

```
