# TASK1 : Fiber Switching in C++ with Context Library

This project demonstrates the implementation of fiber switching in C++ using a provided context library. Fibers are lightweight threads with their own stack, and this example shows how to switch between different fibers.

## Introduction

In this project, we implement a simple program that utilizes the provided context library to switch between different fibers. The context library consists of functions to save and restore the execution state, allowing for the creation of lightweight fibers.



## Building

1. Assemble Assembly Code:
This command assembles the context.s assembly file into machine code and saves the result in context.o.

2. Compile C++ Source Code to Object File:
This command compiles the fibers.cpp source file into machine code and saves the result in fibers.o.

3. Link Object Files to Create Executable:
This command links the previously compiled fibers.o and context.o object files into an executable named fibers. 

```bash
as -o context.o context.s
g++ -c fibers.cpp -o fibers.o
g++ fibers.o context.o -o fibers

```
## Running
Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./fibers

```

## Examples

1. **Header Inclusions:**
   - `#include <iostream>`: Allows the program to perform input and output operations.
   - `#include <cstdint>`: Provides fixed-width integer types (`uint32_t`, `uintptr_t`, etc.).
   - `#include "context.hpp"`: Includes the header file for the provided context-switching library.

2. **Global Variables:**
   - `volatile bool x = false;`: A volatile boolean variable used to control the flow of execution. Its volatility ensures that the compiler does not optimize its usage.

3. **Global Contexts:**
   - `Context main_context;` and `Context goo_context;`: Two instances of the `Context` structure provided by the context library. These represent the execution contexts for the main function and the `goo` function.

4. **Function Declarations:**
   - `void goo();`: Forward declaration for the `goo` function.

5. **Function Definitions:**
   - `void foo()`: Outputs a message and then switches control to the `goo` function using the context-switching library.
   - `void goo()`: Outputs a message.

6. **Main Function:**
   - Allocates memory for the main stack, including additional space for the Red Zone, following the System V ABI.
   - Aligns the main stack to 16 bytes and adjusts the stack pointer for the Red Zone.
   - Retrieves the current context as the main context, sets up the `foo` function as the entry point, and sets the stack pointer.
   - Calls the context-switching library function `set_context` to switch control to the `foo` function.
   - After `foo` completes, control returns to the main function, and the program checks the condition of the volatile variable `x`. If true, it outputs a message.
   - Deallocates the main stack memory.

## Code Snippets

### `context.hpp`

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

struct Context {
    void* rip, *rsp;
    void* rbx, *rbp, *r12, *r13, *r14, *r15;
};

extern "C" int get_context(Context* c);
extern "C" void set_context(Context* c);
extern "C" void swap_context(Context* out, Context* in);

```
